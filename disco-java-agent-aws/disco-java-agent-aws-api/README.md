## Disco 'AWS' API Package

This package contains classes and interfaces which are extended and implemented by the `disco-java-agent-aws` library
as Disco Events. Consumers of Disco AWS Support can optionally depend on this package to cast Events received from the
event bus to these types and not lose any AWS-SDK-specific data from downcasting.
