# DiSCo Instrumentation Preprocessing Library

This extension for the DiSCo toolkit provides a CLI which can "preprocess" classes by performing
bytecode manipulation before runtime.

## Development

You may need to install the IntelliJ Lombok plugin for your project in order for the tests to pass.
Instructions can be found on [the plugin's readme](https://github.com/mplushnikov/lombok-intellij-plugin#installation).
